1. To run this project, you need to set up your database and seed the data. First, create two files: .env.development and .env.test to configure your databases. You can use the npm script npm run setup-dbs to set up the databases.
   For an example of how to configure your own database, take a look at the .env.example file.
   Additionally, make sure to add .env\* to your .gitignore file to protect your sensitive data.
   Finally, for the first step, you need to install the following dependencies: npm, jest, pg, and pg-format.
